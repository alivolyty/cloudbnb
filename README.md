Cloudbnb
========

NOTE: I have recieved a few inqueries over the years about this project, and an issue was created asking me to add a license to this repo. I did that, but you should be aware of the intent of this project before you attempt to make it functional for your purposes.

This was my final project for the [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/) bootcamp. It was built very quickly over a two week period for the purpose of displaying my skills to future employers. No part of this project was built with the intent of creating a functional commercial website.

I would caution against attempting to use this for commercial purposes, and I have no interest in attemting to do so myself.

SUMMARY:
--------
[Cloudbnb](http://cloudbnb.herokuapp.com/) is a faithful Airbnb clone. Backed by Rails, it replicates many of the core user-facing features of Airbnb. It is important to note that I did all of the css myself without the use of Bootstrap or other framework.
